The background routine at 0x6D17 calculates a number of parameters for
the knock sensing and determines when to activate the tip-in retard.
The knock sensor hardware is of course absent on Fox Mustangs.  If we
wish to delete the tip-in retard logic as well, we can simply omit
this routine from the background tables.

However, if we want to preserve the option of tip-in retard while
eliminating the knock sensor logic, here are a couple of simple
changes.

First, change all references of 17 6D (word 0x6D17) in the background
table to AA 6D (word 0x6DAA). This is the location at which the tip-in
retard logic starts.

Second, patch in a RET instruction at 0x6E10:

Is:

4E10: 9B F8 3C B0

Becomes:

4E10: F0 FF FF FF
